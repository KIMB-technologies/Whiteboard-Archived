# WBO
WBO is an online collaborative whiteboard that allows many users to draw simultaneously on a large virtual board.
The board is updated in real time for all connected users, and its state is always persisted. It can be used for many different purposes, including art, entertainment, design, teaching.

## Changes of this fork
- **Display a background image to draw on**
- Node in Docker container not running as root
- English only
- Different startpage showing last visted boards
- Some smaller changes

## Why
Running this as a private self-hosted instance, AGPL causes me to publish it.
